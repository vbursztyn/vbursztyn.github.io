To support data integration into pictorials, we propose Data Pictorial, a pipeline that deconstructs a raster image into SVG objects whose attributes are contextualized in data. This process is achieved by cropping objects of interest using zero-shot detection, converting them into quantized bitmaps, and tracing the results as SVG paths. The technique then provides suggestions for binding the SVG objects and properties with data fields, affording the flexibility to automatically modify and animate the SVG based on the mapping. The resultant data-aware vector hypermedia can be potential candidates for real-time data inspection and personalization, all while maintaining the aesthetic of the original pictorial.
