Answering questions over multi-page, multimodal documents, including text and figures, is a critical challenge for applications that require answers to integrate information across multiple modalities and contextual dependencies. Existing methods, such as single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), struggle to retrieve fine-grained and contextually relevant information from large, heterogeneous documents, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by iterative frameworks like ReAct, which refine retrieval through feedback, we propose Doc-React, an adaptive iterative framework that balances information gain and uncertainty reduction at each step. Doc-React leverages InfoNCE-guided retrieval to approximate mutual information, enabling dynamic sub-query generation and refinement. A large language model (LLM) serves as both a judge and generator, providing structured feedback to iteratively improve retrieval. By combining mutual information optimization with entropy-aware selection, Doc-React systematically captures relevant multimodal content, achieving strong performance on complex QA tasks.
