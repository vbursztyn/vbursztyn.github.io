Automatically generated insights can help people interpret key trends in their data; similarly, dashboard summaries can highlight key insights for large and complex analytic dashboards that combine multiple datasets or visualizations. In this work we perform a case study evaluation with five industry professionals to understand how people prioritize insights and author concise summaries; to inform the design of improved automatic techniques, we compare the results to a fully automatic approach. We observed three notable characteristics of human-authored dashboard summaries compared to the automatic method: (1) incorporation of explanations or speculation, (2) improved structural consistency in the text, and (3) careful consideration of the precision for numeric values.
