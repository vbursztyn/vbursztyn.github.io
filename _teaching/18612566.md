The present disclosure relates to systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable media that iteratively generates, utilizing a machine learning model, text responses to reduce hallucinated content. In particular, in some embodiments, the disclosed systems receive a digital query and selects one or more supporting digital documents for the digital query. Furthermore, in some embodiments the disclosed systems generate a first text response from a first text prompt generated by using the digital query. Moreover, in some embodiments the disclosed systems extract a misalignment portion of the first text response by comparing the first text response and the one or more supporting digital documents. Additionally, from the misalignment portion of the first text response and the digital query, the disclosed systems further generate a second text response.
