Content planning techniques are provided that recommend content features based on the investment interest of advertisers in various audience segments and historical audience measurements. An exemplary method comprises obtaining historical data comprising content preferences indicating a performance metric for each pair of a plurality of content items and audience segment, wherein the content items comprise a plurality of content features indicating characteristics of a corresponding content item; obtaining, for each of a plurality of advertisers, a weight indicating a future interest of a given advertiser in a given audience segment; calculating a pairwise similarity between a vector of the content preferences and a vector of the weights for the plurality of the audience segments to obtain a ranked list of the content items sorted by the pairwise similarity; and generating a summarization of the content features to be used in future content items based on the ranked list.
