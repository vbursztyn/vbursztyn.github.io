Methods and systems are provided for using generative artificial intelligence to evaluate fine-tuned language models. In embodiments described herein, natural language text snippets are generated via a generative language model based on corresponding data. A language model is fine-tuned into a fine-tuned language model via a language model fine-tuning component using the natural language text snippets and the corresponding data as training data. Independent natural language text snippets are generated via the generative language model based on the corresponding data. Each independent natural language text snippet is different than each corresponding natural language text snippet. An evaluation metric of the fine-tuned language model is generated via an evaluation component based on the independent natural language text snippets and the corresponding data.
