Systems and methods for generating hierarchical queries from text queries are described. Embodiments are configured to encode a text query to obtain a text embedding. Then, embodiments select a field of a data schema by comparing the text embedding to a field embedding corresponding to the field. Subsequently, embodiments generate a hierarchical query including a value corresponding to the selected field. Some embodiments further include one or more formatting models configured to format values included in the text query.
