Product planning techniques are provided that recommend compositions of product features for weighted heterogeneous consumer segments using regression trees. An exemplary method comprises obtaining historical consumer data comprising product preferences for existing product items for multiple consumer segments; obtaining product features indicating characteristics for each existing product item; prioritizing the consumer segments by obtaining a weight indicating an interest in each consumer segment; computing a total performance metric, for each product item, by calculating a dot product between the consumer segment weights and respective preferences of the consumer segments regarding a given product item; obtaining a regression tree from the existing product items to predict the total performance metric in terms of corresponding product features; and selecting a combination of the product features to be used in future product items based on identified paths in the regression tree.
