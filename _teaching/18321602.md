Methods and systems are provided for hallucination prevention for natural language insights. In embodiments described herein, a template-based insight with a set of facts is generated by a template-based insights engine. The set of facts are generated from a set of data and the template-based insight is generated based on a text template. A natural language insight is generated from the template-based insight through a language model. If a threshold number of facts of the template-based insight are missing from the natural language insight as determined by a hallucination gatekeeper engine then a new natural language insight is generated from the template-based insight through the language model.
