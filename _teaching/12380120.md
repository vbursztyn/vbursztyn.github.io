A method, apparatus, non-transitory computer readable medium, and system for document retrieval include obtaining a query and a document. A prompt generator generates a prompt for a reasoning model based on the query and the document. The reasoning model generates a reasoning result based on the prompt. In some cases, the reasoning result indicates that the document answers the query. A machine learning model provides the document in response to the query based on the reasoning result.
