Systems and methods for natural language processing are described. Embodiments of the present disclosure obtain a chart and a query via a user interface. An answer model generates an answer to the query based on the chart, wherein the answer model comprises a machine learning model trained based on chart data for the chart. A description model generates a visual description based on the answer and the chart, wherein the description model comprises a machine learning model trained based on a chart specification for the chart. A response component transmits a response to the query based on the answer and the visual description.
