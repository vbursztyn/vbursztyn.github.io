Methods, systems, and non-transitory computer readable storage media are disclosed for generating action plans utilizing a large language model with a best-first search model. The disclosed system determines a request to utilize a large language model to generate an action plan via one or more software tools. The disclosed system generates the action plan by traversing a decision tree comprising an action space involving the one or more software tools by iteratively: selecting, utilizing a best-first search model, an action from a set of possible actions in the action space of the decision tree; and expanding, utilizing the best-first search model, the action space of the decision tree to include an additional set of possible actions. The disclosed system also executes the action plan via one or more interactions with the one or more software tools according to the action.
